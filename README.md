_You **can** combine  them.

My tasks today are:

1. Teach Gabby.
1. Teach myself.
    1. I realize that I need to invent stories to entertain myself to learn and remember as well.
    1. After all all human beings of all ages learn in the same method, that is, via interests.
  
* Interests are the only teacher.
  *  A good one as well.
    * Trust me.
